	‚Ä¢	Start, pause, stop timer functionality.
	‚Ä¢	Manual addition/editing of time records.
	‚Ä¢	Handling overlaps and corrections.
	‚Ä¢	Data Handling:
	‚Ä¢	Input: Activity name, start/end time, optional notes.
	‚Ä¢	Output: Saved time-log entries.
	‚Ä¢	Storage: Local IndexedDB (initial MVP).
	‚Ä¢	UI Layout/Elements:
	‚Ä¢	Main page with ‚ÄúStart Timer‚Äù button.
	‚Ä¢	Active timer indicator.
	‚Ä¢	Quick-add/edit entry dialog.
	‚Ä¢	API/Integration Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	No external API integration required in MVP.
	‚Ä¢	Implementation Steps:
	1.	Set up frontend page & state management.
	2.	Timer logic (start/stop/pause).
	3.	CRUD operations for time entries.
	‚Ä¢	Technologies:
	‚Ä¢	Windsurf, React, TypeScript
	‚Ä¢	IndexedDB (via localForage or similar)
	‚Ä¢	Testing Considerations:
	‚Ä¢	Unit tests for timer logic.
	‚Ä¢	Integration tests for CRUD operations.

üìÇ Function 2: Activity Categorization
	‚Ä¢	Description:
Allow users to define and assign categories for each recorded activity.
	‚Ä¢	Functional Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	Pre-defined default categories.
	‚Ä¢	CRUD operations for categories.
	‚Ä¢	Assign categories quickly during time tracking.
	‚Ä¢	Data Handling:
	‚Ä¢	Input: Category name, parent category (optional).
	‚Ä¢	Output: Categorized time entries.
	‚Ä¢	Storage: IndexedDB (local storage).
	‚Ä¢	UI Layout/Elements:
	‚Ä¢	Categories management panel.
	‚Ä¢	Dropdown selection during task logging.
	‚Ä¢	Implementation Steps:
	1.	Develop category management module (create/edit/delete).
	2.	Link category data with time-log entries.
	‚Ä¢	Technologies:
	‚Ä¢	React Components in Windsurf
	‚Ä¢	IndexedDB storage via localForage
	‚Ä¢	Testing Considerations:
	‚Ä¢	CRUD operation tests for category management.
	‚Ä¢	Category selection consistency.
	‚Ä¢	Reference:
	‚Ä¢	React Select component

üìä Function 3: Basic Analytics Dashboard
	‚Ä¢	Description:
Visual representation (charts) of daily and weekly activities to help users analyze their time distribution.
	‚Ä¢	Functional Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	Daily and weekly summary (pie chart, bar chart).
	‚Ä¢	Basic reporting: total logged time per category.
	‚Ä¢	Data Handling:
	‚Ä¢	Input: Stored time-log entries.
	‚Ä¢	Output: Aggregated data for visualization.
	‚Ä¢	UI Layout/Elements:
	‚Ä¢	Simple dashboard with daily/weekly toggle.
	‚Ä¢	Charts displaying time spent per category.
	‚Ä¢	API/Integration Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	No external API in MVP; internal data processing only.
	‚Ä¢	Implementation Steps:
	1.	Retrieve and aggregate data from IndexedDB.
	2.	Implement charts using Chart.js or ECharts.
	‚Ä¢	Technologies:
	‚Ä¢	Windsurf, React
	‚Ä¢	Chart.js or Apache ECharts
	‚Ä¢	Testing Considerations:
	‚Ä¢	Data aggregation logic.
