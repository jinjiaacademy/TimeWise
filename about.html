                <div class="about-content">
                    <h3>The Lyubishev Time-Tracking Method</h3>
                    <p>TimeWise is inspired by the time management system developed by Alexander Lyubishev, a Russian entomologist and philosopher who lived from 1890 to 1972. Lyubishev meticulously tracked his time for over 50 years, which allowed him to achieve extraordinary productivity in his scientific work while maintaining a balanced life.</p>
                    
                    <p>The core principles of the Lyubishev method include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Detailed Time Recording:</strong> Track all activities throughout the day, including work, study, leisure, and personal time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Categorization:</strong> Group activities into meaningful categories to identify patterns and balance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regular Analysis:</strong> Review time usage periodically to optimize productivity and ensure alignment with personal goals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Use insights from tracking to make deliberate choices about how to spend time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Unlike modern productivity systems that focus on maximizing work output, Lyubishev's approach emphasizes conscious time allocation across all life areas, leading to sustainable productivity and personal fulfillment.</p>
